# Parallelizing Actor Critic Algorithms to Improve Training Turnaround Time
The primary directory of this project is 'PPO' which contains all the work carried out during the dissertation phase of the HPC Msc, meanwhile 'TD3' consists of all the work completed during the feasability study phase in preparation for the dissertation. Each directory has an appropriate README file that contains information and installation instructions.

## Directory structure:

- PPO/
	* Work conducted during the dissertation stage of the HPC Msc involving on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization trained on the DeepMind's StarCraft II Learning Environments.

- TD3/
	* Work carried out during feasability study that investigated off-policy Twin Delayed DDPG on the OpenAI Gym Environments.

- Minutes/
	* Formal write-ups of meetings, containing points of discussion, updates and actions to be completed.
