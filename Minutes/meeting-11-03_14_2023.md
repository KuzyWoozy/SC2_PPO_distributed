## Supervisor Meeting 11
**Date:** 14th July 2023

**Location:** Bayes Center Room 2.02

**Next meeting:** 21st July 

### Attendees:
* Dr Evgenij Belikov
* Daniil Kuznetsov

### Discussion:
* Addressed why weak scaling had lacking results, decided to try greater growth rate as well as attempt to profile to understand any bottlenecks that could be present.
* Discussed potential new features as part of the feature engineering to improve training score performance.
* Looked over plotted graphs, deciding to add parallel and serial efficiency as well as mixed precision analysis for the GPU scaling.

### Previous Meeting Actions:
* Proceed with the scalabity studies showing the effects of exploration on the agent performance. (Done)
* Begin writing the report and documenting the results. (Done)
* Create a README for the project, allowing experiments to be ran and models evaluated. (Done)
* Finish integrating FullyConv with the latest changes and perform GPU scalability study on it, comparing it to atari-net performance and scaling. (Done)

### Actions:
* Repeat experimentation results for strong scaling.
* Use a sharper growth rate for the weak scaling problem, pair with ARCHER2's single job queue.
* Continue working on the dissertation report, address GPUs and start background.
* Demonstrate learned stradegies by the agent as part of the conclusion.
