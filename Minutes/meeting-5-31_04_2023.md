## Supervisor Meeting 4
**Date:** 31th March 2023

**Location:** Bayes Center Room 2.02

**Next meeting:** 7th April

### Attendees:
* Dr Evgenij Belikov
* Daniil Kuznetsov

### Discussion:
* Reviewed the feasability study, going over any corrections and comments made prior to the meeting. Discussed moving forward with the report, emphasise 
* Talked about the scalability study found in A3C paper and how it only covered a very small set of processes, could be evaluted further on the same algorithm or one of the more recent ones.
* Discussed how parallelism does can not only affect performance, but also convergence by providing increased exploration leading to superlinear scalability results observed in the A3C paper.
* Dissected D4PG, analyzing how its worker agents only have an affect on the exploration of the environment and do not improve runtime performance via problem decomposition or increased processing of data (what A3C does and could explain the reason for superlinear results).
* Postponed meeting with the professors from the Informatics department until after Easter break.

### Actions:
* Continue working on the feasability study report.
* Tidy up the report formatting, and have a finalized version by next meeting.
* Carry out GPU performance testing on the prototype code to estimate required resources.
