## Supervisor Meeting 1
**Date:** 17th February 2023

**Location:** Bayes Room 2.56

### Attendees:
* Dr Evgenij Belikov
* Daniil Kuznetsov

### Discussion:
* Demonstrated the Twin Delayed DDPG prototype across several environments to supervisor.
* Talked about the issue of long training times and high variance of reward, most likely due to compromises made to achieve less than 12 hours training time.
* Discussed how parallelization will help improve the training times for off-policy algorithms by distributing the mini-batch processing when sampling from the replay experience buffer.
* Mentioned how GPUs will allow us to train a bigger model, which should further reduce the variance of the agent rewards during evaluation with sufficient training time.
* Talked about the differences between on-policy and off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithms and how they have different approaches to parallelization because of the use of the behavioral policy. Would be interesting to investigate the parallel scalability for both families of algorithms.
* Mentioned how Python Pytorch front-end may cause a performance hindrance, look into C++ alternatives.

### Actions:
* Make a start on the feasibility report on the matters discussed.
* Ask for GPU hours for the project preparation stage to help evaluate the overall resources required for the entire project.
