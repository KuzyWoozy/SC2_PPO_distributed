## Supervisor Meeting 4
**Date:** 31th March 2023

**Location:** Bayes Center Room 2.02

**Next meeting:** 5th June

### Attendees:
* Dr Evgenij Belikov
* Daniil Kuznetsov

### Discussion:
* Showed the work I have done on the SCII environment, featuring a PPO implementation that learns to play better than random.
* Discussed the next steps for the project, moving the focus towards parallelism and obtaining speedup results.
* Talked about the other minigame environments available and compared their difficulty, could something like this be given a value?
* Mentioned how it would be good to intergrate TD3 into the SCII environment as well, however for now the focus will be on PPO in order to ensure that a minimal viable product is completed in terms of the project.

### Actions:
* Implement regression testing to ensure testable development of new features for PPO.
* Evaluate the PPO algorithm on the SCII environment for a longer duration, see if we can reach the DeepMind baseline.
* Start working of parallelizing PPO, begin with torch MPI functionality.
