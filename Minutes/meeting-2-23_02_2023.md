## Supervisor Meeting 2
**Date:** 23th February 2023

**Location:** Bayes Center

**Next meeting:** 3rd March

### Attendees:
* Dr Evgenij Belikov
* Daniil Kuznetsov

### Discussion:
* Continued our discussion on ways to parallelize T3D discussed cpu, cpu/gpu and multi node gpu setups.
* Talked about searching for alternative computation resources, as a backup.
* Made a point of how it will be useful to find existing performance baselines that could be used to guide the evaluation process.
* There are several research papers that look into parallelization of DDPG, reading them could provide insight into doing the same T3D as it is an extension of DDPG.

### Actions:
* Request GPU hours on Cirrus to help with resource estimation.
* Find and gather the research papers that focus on parallelized DDPG/T3D, see if they contain performance baselines.
