## Supervisor Meeting 12
**Date:** 21th July 2023

**Location:** Bayes Center Room 2.02

**Next meeting:** 28th July 

### Attendees:
* Dr Evgenij Belikov
* Daniil Kuznetsov

### Discussion:
* Discussed next steps for the dissertation report, performing profiling as well as obtaining GPU scalability results.
* Verify FullyConv works performance results, can be difficult due to reliance on GPUs to be able to be trained in reasonable time.
* Comparison between environment performance between best multi-core model trained on ARCHER2 vs GPU accelerated model trained on Cirrus. 
* Begin polishing off sections of the disseratation report for review, however there is still work to be done in terms of methodology and conclusions content.

### Previous Meeting Actions:
* Repeat experimentation results for strong scaling. (Postponed)
* Use a sharper growth rate for the weak scaling problem, pair with ARCHER2's single job queue. (Postponed)
* Continue working on the dissertation report, address GPUs and start background. (Done)
* Demonstrate learned stradegies by the agent as part of the conclusion. (Postponed)

### Actions:
* Polish 'Background' section for review.
* Scalability study on Cirrus GPU partition, as well as 24 hour performance training evaluation on a suitable configuration.
* Write the 'Conclusion' aspect of the report.
* Document learnt strategies by the agent.
