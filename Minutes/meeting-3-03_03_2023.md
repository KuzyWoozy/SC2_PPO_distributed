## Supervisor Meeting 3
**Date:** 3rd March 2023

**Location:** Bayes Center Room 2.02

**Next meeting:** 21st March

### Attendees:
* Dr Evgenij Belikov
* Daniil Kuznetsov

### Discussion:
* Talked about various hardware that the Reinforcement Learning algorithms can map to. Cerebrus/Volta GPUs are particularly interesting to investigate.
* Discussed the work plan, made some feedback and suggested diagrams.
* Made a mention that it will be important to think about the risks and replicatability of results. Setting random seeds should achieve the latter point, however this might not be possible to do with GPUs due to stochastic elements.
* Discussed how parallelizing reinforcement learning algorithms can positively impact research space, such as improving the return time of evaluating new ideas/concepts and tackling the difficult hyperparameter search problem.

### Actions:
* Continue working on the feasibility study.
* Create a diagram for the work plan.
* Consider changing the title of the Project to something more concrete.
